# on launch, load the dictionary

    # select all words with .length between 5 and 12

    # select a random word from those

    # create an array of equal length to the word, default value "_"

    # print that array and ask the player for a guess

        # also need to print some way of tracking guesses remaining and previously guessed letters

# get player guess

    # compare it to the randomly chosen word (if it was already guessed, tell them and ask again)

    # reveal all letters that match in the guess array

    # print, then ask for another guess

    # when guesses exceed the allowed amount, end the game and reveal the word

    # maybe save all played games to some kind of log file

# allow saving at any time

    # if the player enters "save" as their guess, save gamestate info to a file
        # guesses remaining, current revealed letters, previous guesses, player name
